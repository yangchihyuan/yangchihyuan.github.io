![Summer Intern Opportunities](https://www.makeintern.com/admin/uploaded_images/blog/images/summer-internship.jpg)
We have 3 intern slots for international studnets. The wage is 20K NTD per month for 2 months, and their tasks are to develop the features of my Zenbo Nurse Helper project, including occlusion-aware facial feature recognition, voice recognition, LLM-based dialog sentence generation. Please contact me if you are interested.
Goal: 



#### Companion-robot helper for nurses in a pediatric ward
![PICU Scenario](http://yangchihyuan.github.io/assets/img/PICU_Scenario_1.jpg)

This is a project for developing a companion robot to help nurses in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). There is a shortage of nurses in Taiwan, due to several factors such as low salaries, unsatisfying working environment, and the reduction of young working labors in the population structure caused by sub-replacement fertility. In a PICU, children have to be separated from their parents for most time due to the sanity issue. In contrast, a companion robot can be totally sanitized and stay in the PICU. In practice, a PICU nurse usually needs to take care of multiple wards to make the operation economic. When a nurse is busy for one ward, she/he needs a helper to look after other wards. Currently such a duty is delegated to a nurse colleague, so there are multiple nurses on duty in a PICU.

#### Depth estimation in an eye ball

For intraocular microsurgery, robotic assistance is a cutting-edge research field because it is promising for expanding human capabilities and improving the safety and efficiency of the intricate surgery process. Because depth is critical for intraocular microsurgery, in this project we want to estimate the depth of the medical devices in an eye ball. We want to develop a method which can warm the operator if the device is too close to the retina.

#### Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition

Current research results have been published in ECCV'24 and the paper is available in my publication webpage [(Link)](https://yangchihyuan.github.io/publications). However, there are some puzzles unsolved yet. For example, why does this method work poorly on some action datasets? How will the quality of text affect the method's performance? If we refine the text description of the NTU RGB+D dataset, what will happen? Is the skeleton data of the NTU RGB+D dataset so noisy that the proposed method works? Given a high-quality skeleton action dataset, will the proposed method still work?
To answer those questions, further research is required to be carried out.

The primary researcher of this project is a Ph.D. student of the CGU school of Traditional Chinese Medicine and I am a consultant of this project. We want to compile a dataset consisting of tongue images and syndromes of digestive system diseases. Thereafter, we can train a computer vision model to predict digestive system diseases from tongue images. In the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, digestive system diseases and tongue appearance are highly related. But modern western medicine system totally ignores it. The most challenging part of this research lies in the data collection, segmentation and labeling. 
Because this is an application-oriented research project, they plan to use the well-developed ResNet as their prediction model. Thus, the contribution of this project is to validate the traditional Chinese medicine theory and develop a practical method to apply it rather than exploring computer vision techniques.
