title: "Advanced Computer Vision 2026"
---

Spring 2026, Friday 1:10pm to 4:00pm, Classroom: TBD <br/>
Instructor: Chih-Yuan Yang

#### Course Information
This course is titled Advanced Computer Vision. However, the field is vast—in 2025 alone, CVPR saw over 2,800 papers published, not to mention specialized CV conferences like ICCV and WACV, or major AI venues like NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, and AAAI. At an advanced level, we must shift our focus toward specific areas of expertise rather than attempting to cover fundamental knowledge. In this class, I want to guide students through the latest research papers to explore their new ideas, the problems they aim to solve, their current limitations, and their relevance to students’ own research. I expect students to answer these core questions: What is the paper proposing? Is the source code available? Are the results reproducible? How does their approach benefit your research? And finally, are there ways to improve upon their solutions? As this is a literature-heavy course, I assume students already possess foundational knowledge in Computer Vision. While I do not plan to lecture on basic concepts like pixels, color spaces, filters, or neural networks, I will step in to clarify concepts or provide necessary background if discussions become confusing or technical gaps arise.

#### Prerequisites

In this course, I want students to read the latest papers from top computer vision conferences and journals, which are the state-of-the-art research reports. Students need to present their findings, understanding, reproduced experimental results, and ideas for improvements in the classroom. By understanding those cutting-edge methods, students should gain knowledge and get some ideas for their own research.
This course requires programming experience and fundamental knowledge of computer vision.

#### Textbook
We do not have a textbook because the knowledge reported by latest research papers is too new to be covered by a textbook. An evoling large language model is more useful than a textbook for you to retrive new knowledge.

#### Grading
Your final grade will be made up from
- 50% Your paper presentations in the classroom
- 10% Discussion participation in the classroom
- 40% Term project, including proposal (5%), midterm presentation (10%), final project presentation (15%), and final project report (10%). Maximum 5 members each group.
- late policy<br/>
I do not have a strict late policy because there are only a few students taking this course. I will directly ask students why I do not see their submissions via Teams messages.
