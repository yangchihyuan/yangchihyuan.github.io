<!--AIM009-63664-->
Fall 2024, Monday 1:10pm to 4:00pm, Classroom: C0206R (Second Medical Science Building 206) <br/>
Instructor: Chih-Yuan Yang

#### Course Information

In this course, I will introduce fundamental concepts of computer vision. I expect students can understand a few important topics in computer vision such as image processing, color spaces, recognition, convolutional neural networks, generative models, vision-language models. Through discussion in the class and implementation for projects, students should learn concepts and first-hand experience of applying computer vision knowledge for real-world applications.

The course consists of four programming projects and one final group project (max 5 members each team). Please find information about final project in the syllabus.

#### Prerequisites

This course requires programming experience as well as linear algebra, basic calculus, and basic probability. Previous knowledge of visual computing will be helpful.

#### Grading
Your final grade will be made up from
- 40% 4 pieces of homework
- 60% term project, including proposal (5%), project pitch (10%), midterm report (10%), final project presentation (20%), and final project report(15%). Maximum 5 members each group.
- late policy<br/>
You will lose 10% each day for a late submission. However, you have three "late days" for the whole course. That is to say, the first 24 hours after the due date counts as 1 day, up to 48 hours is two and 72 for the third late day. After running out of the three "late days", I will deduct the penalty from your points.
