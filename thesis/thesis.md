# 1 Poor translation
"Global healthcare systems are increasingly challenged by workforce shortages, burnout, and excessive workloads. Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) have emerged as a potential solution. Although SARs have demonstrated potential in pediatric care, existing research has largely concentrated on technological development or patient-centered perspectives, with insufficient focus on the experiences and professional insights of frontline healthcare providers."

This English abstract is translated from its Chinese version using a translation tool.

"隨著全球醫療體系面臨人力短缺、職業倦怠與工作負荷過重等挑戰，社交輔助機器人（Socially Assistive Robots, SARs）在臨床照護中的應用逐漸受到關注。雖然 SARs 在兒科醫療中展現潛力，但現有研究多聚焦於機器人發展的技術面或病患觀點，缺乏對第一線醫護人員經驗與專業角色看法的深入探討，並且多數研究缺乏理論依據以及實際使用的經驗。"

Advice: Find a native speaker to rewrite those sentences.
